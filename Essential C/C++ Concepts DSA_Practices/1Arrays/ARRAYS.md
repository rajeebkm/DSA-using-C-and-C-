# Arrays

Arrays are defined as a collection of similar data elements.

When the program is running, it runs inside the main memory. The main memory is divided into three sections i.e. code section, and stack and heap. program code will be inside the code section and with any variable declared, like an array is declared inside main function, so array in main function will be created inside the stack.
