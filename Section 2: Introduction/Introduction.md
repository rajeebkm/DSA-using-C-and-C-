5. Big Data


1. Data Structure

Arrangement of Data, inside main memory called Data Structure. Organization/arrangement of Data inside main memory so that it can be used more efficiently called Data Structure. 

a) CPU (Central Processing Unit): Execute our program/instructions
b) Main Memory (RAM): Temporary Memory/Working Memory, called Primary Memory
c) HDD/Storage (Hard Disk Drive): Permanent Storage, (Prog File (Example: MS-Word File), Data File(docx file))

Example: When we run or click on any program like MS-Word, it will be brought to Main Memory, program contains set of instructions, then CPU will start executing the MS-Word program and MS-Word application will be opened.

Then If we want to access Data File like docx, it will be brought to main memory.

So, Program has to be brought to the main memory for its execution and also data has to be brought into the main memory for processing of the data so that instruction can make operations on data. Program cann't directly access the data keeping on its storage/HDD.


2. Database

Where there is lot of datas, data should be arranged in table or relational tables like commercial data, called database. Databases are also stored in HDD. We have to pull the data from databases into the main memory so that we can use the data, so we need the data structure for arrangement of data in main memory.


How the data is organised in the form of tables/relational models in HDD/permanent storage so that it can be retrieved, called Databases.



3. Data Warehouse

There are huge amount of datas out of which some are used daily, some are not used.

Commercial Data
a) Operational Data (Daily Basis)
b) Legacy Data (Old Data/Historical)

The large size data which is kept in the form of disk that is acting as a historical data for any commercial firms,
called Data warehouse. Huge size data which are inactive now, can be retrieved when necessary called Data Warehouse. 

The algorithm used for analyzing those data called Data Mining Algorithm.


4. Big Data

With the start of internet, a huge sized data is accumulating, day by day in Internet, that data is about things, about people, about places, lot of data is available in the Internet. And by analyzing that data we can take a lot of decisions, that is for management, for governance, or for businesses.

Analysis is very useful about that data.

Storing and analyzing the data called Big Data that is used in internet.
