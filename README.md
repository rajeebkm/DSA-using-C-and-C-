# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C / C++

## Section 1: Before we start

Introduction
------------

Topics: Arrays, Matrices, Linked List, Stack, Queues,Trees, Graph, Hashing, Recursion, Sortings
Languages: C, C++, Java, C#, Python, JavaScript etc.

A program is a set of instructions which performs operations on data. So without data, instructions cannot be performed. So data is an important part of a program.

So when a program is dealing with the data, how it will organize the data in the main memory, that's what its data structures, the way you organize the data in the main memory during execution time of a program that is data structure.

Different types of Data Structures:
-----------------------------------
1. Physical Data Structure: Defines how the data is arranged in the memory. Example: Arrays, Matrices, Linked List
2. Logical Data Structure: Defines how the data can be utilized. Example: Stack, Queues,Trees, Graph, Hashing
